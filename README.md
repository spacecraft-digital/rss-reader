# RSS Application Brief

## Background

Google have closed down their popular RSS reader web application. As avid RSS users as well as software engineers we would like to create a new RSS reader that we have full control over.

## The brief
 
We would like you to write a small application that can perform the following operations:

* Allow a user to enter a new RSS Feed link and add this to a database
* Lists all current RSS Feeds held within the database
* Allow each RSS Feed link to be updated and/or deleted
* View the contents of a single RSS Feed at a time (i.e. parse the contents of the feed and present it to the user)

The application must be written using PHP and MySQL.

You may feel free to add any creative ﬂair or additional features that you see ﬁt, however we will be looking at the quality of your overall application, and not the number of features that you choose to implement.

Some RSS feeds that you may wish to use for testing purposes are:

* [http://www.php.net/news.rss](http://www.php.net/news.rss)
* [http://slashdot.org/rss/slashdot.rss](http://slashdot.org/rss/slashdot.rss)
* [http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_uk_edition/front_page/rss.xml](http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_uk_edition/front_page/rss.xml)

_Note:_ please do not use an open source framework or components (e.g. Zend, Symfony) for your submission. We do make use of these open source libraries but for the purposes of this exercise want to see how you code the solution.

## Deliverables

At a minimum, please provide the following:

* all ﬁles required by your application in order to work
* install.txt - any instructions that we will need in order to install your application
* database.txt - provides the SQL queries used to create your database tables and any sample or default data
* any other supporting documents

We are particularly interested in the approach you take in writing your application, including the planning, object-oriented code design and development, testing and documentation.
